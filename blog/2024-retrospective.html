                                <h3>2024 Recap</h3>
                                <p class="hero-description">2024 was by far one of the craziest yet rewarding years of my life. It was the culmination of at least two years of turmoil and hard work, but in the end, it was worth it.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">In comparison to the beginning of 2023 -- which saw me losing my job and having to move back in with my parents after nearly a decade of living on my own -- the beginning of 2024 was a breeze. It was a bit chilly, but I had a cozy job working as a barista at a local coffee shop. The goal: to save enough money to leave my town behind and finally take the leap into marriage. With my then fiancée being Brazilian and US immigration being both expensive and complicated for no good reason, coupled with the US's disdain for the people of Latin America, we decided that it would be best if I moved to Brazil.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">By March, with everything I had saved the year prior, it was time. The ticket had already been booked ahead of time in an effort to make it cheaper and beat impending visa requirements, so all that was left was to pack and move. While I'm definitely the kind of person who would move herself across the world to be with somebody, I'm not foolish enough to go without having visited before. I came to visit my wife for three months back in 2022, back when she was still my girlfriend. Be that as it may, that didn't stop everyone from asking if I knew what I was getting myself into.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">And of course, while I couldn't be sure of all of the cultural norms and quirks of Brazilian life, because even Brazilians don't sometimes (the country is massive), I had several years worth of lessons and advice from my wife. Even still, that first trip was like nothing I'd ever known -- and I loved every single minute of it. Something about life in Brazil clicked with me on a fundamental level, and even though I knew it would be difficult to adjust, I knew I had to at least go for it.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">So I did. I arrived in Brazil on the first of April, 2024, and my wife and I hit the ground running. We had meticulously researched all the paperwork we needed both for us to get married as well as for me to immigrate as a legal permanent resident. That sprint soon ground to a walk, because well... if you know anything about Brazil outside of its beauty and the kindness of its people, you would know that anything and everything is bureaucratized. Dealing with it as a citizen is annoying and painful at times, but navigating it as a gringa? Excruciating.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">Still, we persisted despite the near-constant delays, and we were able to get legally married. It took about a month after that for us to get an appointment for my residency interview, but I am happy to say that dealing with the Polícia Federal was the most pleasant government experience I've had to date. I was given temporary card and told to wait three months for my permanent one. And that, as they say, was that.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">By this point, it was nearly the holiday season, which meant that for the first time since we'd started seeing each other, my wife and I would get to spend my birthday, Christmas, and New Years with each other. I couldn't have been happier. With that, the year was already over, and I was headed toward a brighter future.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description">Which brings us neatly to 2025.</p>
                                <h3>2025 Goals</h3>
                                <p class="hero-description">I want 2025 to be a year of productivity and prosperity. I am aiming to work harder than ever to make that happen, and for the first time in several years, I feel the general malaise and brain fog disappearing as I make a concerted effort to put the hours in each day.</p>
                                <p class="hero-description"><b>Coding:</b> This year I plan to take on more projects than the last two years combined. I started off the year strong with a commission for a portfolio website, but I would like to increase my knowledge of React and sharpen my existing skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to become a well-rounded front-end web developer by year's end. To start, I will complete Scrimba's free React course, a course I bought on Udemy, and the Responsive Web Design course on <a href="http://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp</a>. I expect that this alone will take over a hundred hours, but alongside those courses I will also be designing and coding websites for my portfolio. It goes without saying, but polishing my website is at the top of my priority list.
                                </p>
                                <p class="hero-description"><b>Professional:</b> I have never really put myself out there before. I haven't cared for social media since MySpace, and I never really felt a pressure to network or connect. Now that I want to do web development full time, I'm finding that connections are critical to success. To that end, I recently made myself a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andreamelodev.bsky.social" target="_blank">BlueSky account</a> to try and put myself out there and start talking to people in my field.
                                </p>
                                <p class="hero-description"><b>Health:</b> Like many developers, I struggle with properly balancing the sedentary lifestyle that comes with the job. Sitting in front of a computer all day and plucking away at the keyboard, while my dream career, leads to health complications if you're not careful. I don't have any specific goals in mind, I just want to be more active than I have been the past few months.
                                </p>
                                <p class="hero-description"><b>Personal:</b> Having moved to Brazil as an American, I can admit I was woefully unprepared as far as speaking Portuguese goes. I can understand a lot of spoken Portuguese and enough written Portuguese to be able to read the news. Improving that will be my key to a happy and successful life here.
                                </p>
                                <p class="hero-description"><b>Gaming:</b> As an MMO lover, I've tried just about every MMO out there, but I have to say, Final Fantasy XI has a special place in my heart. It's an older, dated game, sure, but the charm more than makes up for it. I even got my wife into it at some point last year, but we haven't really played it much since. I plan to rekindle that spark and play a bunch of it this year. Guild Wars 2 is my current home MMO, and it's high time I got more serious about actually playing it. I'd love to get full map completion on at least one character, and ideally I would like a set of Legendary armor.
