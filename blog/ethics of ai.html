To be clear: I believe that generative AI does more harm than good long-term. Its use is immoral and unethical to start, and barring certain use cases in web and software development, generative AI as a means to produce large amounts of code is simply inefficient and ineffective.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description"> <b>Summary:</b> I discuss my belief that the use of generative AI -- whether it is to create images, a story, voices for unvoiced NPC dialogue, designs, or code -- is ethically and morally ambiguous at best.</p>

                                    <p class="hero-description">In simple terms, generative artificial intelligence, hereafter referred to as genAI, is a subsection of AI technology that, with a simple user prompt, generates text (incl. plain text *and* code), images, videos, etc. For those who are unaware of how this works and without getting terribly technical, genAI models use a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning" target="_blank">self-supervised learning</a> to comb through large data sets and recognize underlying patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Up until the early 2020s, genAI was mostly restricted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large language models</a> (LLMs) which deal with natural language processing. However, with recent advancements and the addition of newer datasets, the capabilities of genAI are growing.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">For a deeper understanding of what genAI is, its history, and what it can do, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence#Concerns" target="_blank">this wikipedia article</a>.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Now that you understand what genAI is, I would like to touch upon its impact on art, development, voice acting, and and discuss the ethics of its use.</p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-art">Art</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">It is becoming increasingly difficult to exist anywhere on the internet without seeing AI-generated images. Even despite my best efforts to curate my Youtube algorithm, I continue to be served AI-generated thumbnails and music. Pinterest is another, far more egregious example. Despite the fact that I go out of my way to only click on art that, upon visual inspection, seems legitimate and human-made, I cannot avoid the onslaught of AI-generated images.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">More egregious still is the audacity of those who would call this art. There are many who find the look of AI-generated images to be pleasing, and while I disagree, for the most part this is to be expected. As mentioned above, genAI is trained on data sets, and with genAI tools, one can add reference images and specific prompts to achieve a certain look and feel. Like a particular artist and want a piece that looks like they drew it but you're too cheap to pay them for the real thing? Why not use genAI using your favorite pieces of theirs with?!</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Now obviously that statement was satire and meant to be taken with a metric ton of salt, but this mindset is far too common amongst those who are neither artists nor creatives, and it is becoming a real problem for artists who rely on commission work as well as those employed professionally.</p>
                                    <h7 id="a1-jobs">Jobs</h7>
                                    <p class="hero-description">It is no secret that artists and other creatives are widely viewed as lesser despite their critical role in most everything we consume today. If you need proof of this, look no further than the 'starving artist' trope and the way that university students who are in non-STEM fields are treated. Artists get laid of en masse from large corporations with such frequency that it rarely makes it to the headlines anymore. But now, with advent of genAI and its use for generating images, we are seeing this issue magnify.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Online digital artists who have spent years of their lives dedicated to their craft, even those who have successfully navigated the ever-scrolling hellscape of social media and worked long and hard to remain relevant in the eyes of dopamine-addled masses, are having to resort to creating content they otherwise wouldn't (i.e. furry art, NSFW art, etc.) just to pay their bills. Newer artists who are trying to eek out a living and build their careers are being left by the wayside.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">To circle back around to the industry professionals -- those who make the art for the video games we play, the animated shows we watch, etc. -- companies are making concerted efforts to create genAI models that train on their artists' work, and while some union work is being done to stifle pushes from upper management, many artists are given an ultimatum: remain employed for a while longer and have their art and life's work used to develop a genAI model that will create bastardized look-alikes of their work with the inevitability that they will still lose their job, or find different employment which is made an even more monumental task than usual considering the current state of the creative landscape.</p>
                                    <h7 id="a1-slop">'AI Slop'</h7>
                                    <p class="hero-description">My wife refers to AI-generated images as AI slop, and I honestly couldn't think of a more accurate terminology for it. She's not alone in feeling this way, either, as the term has become more and more common of late. But why that phrasing in particular?</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">While AI has come a great distance in the past couple of years, and AI-generated images are becoming increasingly difficult to spot, genAI has seen a plateauing of its capability as far as image generation is concerned. Duchess Celestia has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nm7R1ufq_s&pp=ygUcZHVjaGVzcyBjZWxlc3RpYSBzcG90dGluZyBhaQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive video</a> where she details the most common errors and qualities inherent in AI-generated images. She compares and contrasts these errors with human error to help arm the viewer with knowledge such that they can more accurately spot AI slop and distinguish between it and real art.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">The bulk of what helps me spot AI from a distance is the lighting and composition of any particular piece; GenAI tends to create images with very similar lighting (which often doesn't make sense compositionally) and it rarely generates images where the subject is facing any direction than forward and composed dead center. Failing that, though, genAI is famous for adding extra digits and appendages and the hair and clothing of subjects tend to blend together into unrecognizable masses.</p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-webdev">Web and Software Development</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">While I admit I have little professional experience and therefore cannot comment on the experience of working at a tech company, I have consumed enough content around the subject to have a grasp of the situation and form an opinion.  One of my favorite creators in the space is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@albertatech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alberta Tech.</a></p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">AI can be used in software development in <a href="https://github.com/resources/articles/ai/what-is-ai-code-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three key ways:</a></p>
                                    <ol class="hero-description">
                                        <li class="hero-description-list">Tab-accept autofill suggestions - You start typing and the code editor gives you an unobtrusive suggestion that can be accepted (most often by pressing tab).</li>
                                        <li class="hero-description-list">Comment to generate suggestion - You type a comment in natural language and the AI will suggest code for you.</li>
                                        <li class="hero-description-list">AI chat bot - You type directly to the AI and request code generation. </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Let's talk about them:</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">I personally find the tab-accept autofill suggestions to be quite useful. It helps to cut down on the tedium and increase productivity whilst still letting me take the wheel. This particular flavor of genAI falls in line with stuff like VSCode's Emmet for me. For those unaware, Emmet is an incredibly powerful tool built into VSCode that can take something short and simple like this:</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">nav#navbar>ul.menu>li.menu-item*5</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">and give you this:</p>
                                    <div class="section-content-wrapper">
                                        <div class="side-line"></div>
                                        <div class="section-content">
                                            <pre><code>
&lt;nav id=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;menu-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
                                            </code></pre>
                                        </div>

                                    <p class="hero-description"><em>This is a use case of genAI that I accept.</em></p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Comment to code is significantly more ambiguous. On its face, it would appear to be a souped up version of the tab-accept autofill suggestions, but it isn't. Commenting in plain language and receiving a block of code in return is, in my view, just like going to ChatGPT. Sure, you're only getting a small snippet of code, and in that way you're more in control than you would be if you asked ChatGPT to generate a website for you, but the premise is the same.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">As for chat bot code generation, I think my view is quite clear.</p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-va">Voice Acting and the Deepfake Problem</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">It shouldn't need to be said, but the use of genAI to create videos of people or emulate somebody's voice is dubious at best and abhorrent at worst. So, let's go over some of the issues.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">As regards the emulation of voices, the proliferation of genAI can pose serious security risks. For content creators, actors, and celebrities with large volumes of digital media that includes the usage of their voice, the fear of genAI being used to emulate their voice is apparent. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DqeZZ8ks_SI?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> for instance. Thor, who is a full-time content creator in the game development space across multiple platforms, had to call his bank and put a notice on file that no transactions are to be done over the phone because his voice is all over the internet and a simple AI can be made to spoof his voice over the phone.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">For those who have built their career on the use of their voice as some of your favorite character from video games and television, the threat of losing their jobs to genAI is realer than ever. The most popular MMORPG to date, World of Warcraft, has <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/voiceover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an add-on</a> that voices NPC dialogue using genAI. While it is true that genAI voice models lack the depth and expression of real voices, they still threaten those in the industry. Big names like Jennifer Hale <a href="https://youtu.be/JWCbhgMUDjY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have added their voices</a> to the fight against the genAI craze that has been sweeping the industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Deepfakes have been an issue for years now, and while nobody disputes that they are bad, the problem only continues compounding. It seems so common anymore to see a headline about some celebrity falling victim to a deepfake porn video that uses their likeness. The consequences of this can be damaging for a celebrity's reputation, certainly, but imagine what that could do to someone of less notoriety. One deepfake can ruin a person's marriage, their relationship, and their career. </p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-ethics">Ethics of the use of generative AI</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">I am of the opinion that there is no moral reasoning nor ethical way to use genAI. A lot of the counter arguments I have seen online revolve around the idea that because somebody was compensated for the use of their intellectual property and/or copyrighted material that it makes it okay.  My counter argument to this is exactly what Jennifer Hale had said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jennifer-hale-video-game-strike-sag-aftra-1236125843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>:</p>
                                    <div class="section-content-wrapper">
                                        <div class="side-line"></div>
                                        <div class="section-content">
                                            <p>"If you use something that originated in our body or our voices, can we please get paid? Because now you‚Äôre using technology to take away our ability to feed our kids.</p>
                                            <p class="end-quote">What I wish everyone would do was keep asking the actual question, which is, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs a lot of money being made here. Where is it going?‚Äô And in the current setup, the way our system operates, and this whole idea of shareholder supremacy, it‚Äôs flowing to the 1%. If you flow so much money, you can‚Äôt even feed the people who made it possible.‚Äù</p>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <p class="hero-description">People are being put out of work by genAI. And that's not the only ethical hurdle it faces, either. Unscrupulous business practices have only increased animosity as tech giants like Adobe, Twitter, and Meta tried hide the fact that they started scraping their platforms in updates and terms of service. Additionally, they either make it mandatory or incredibly annoying to opt out of. This means that artists who primarily use social media are forced between a rock and a hard place -- capitulate and let them scrape their work so they can keep making money, or take down their posts and find another way.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">AI sycophants and pundits  like to claim that the models used to train their favorite AI model were ethically procured, but at every turn we find that art ends up appropriated in training datasets without ever being properly licensed. And with no feasible way to know exactly what is in a given AI model's data set, it is next to impossible to say with any degree of certainty that you're not just stealing from somebody.</p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-governance">Governance</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">I believe that there needs to be a comprehensive piece of common-sense legislature passed to regulate the proliferation of AI. US copyright law was built on the fundamental principle that anything you create is yours and yours alone. Whether you put pen to tablet, pencil to paper, fingers to your keyboard, or lend your voice to a character, those are copyrighted works by default. This website and its code (while completely public and open source) would technically be copyright-protected.</p>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Without any regulatory measures in place, and considering the current state of US politics right now I won't hold out any hope, genAI will continue to displace the very people its stealing from.</p>
                                    <h6 id="a1-conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
                                    <p class="hero-description">Considering what I said above, I cannot ever see myself  using genAI in good conscience. There are far too many ethical problems with its creation, proliferation, and use for me to consider it conscionable under any circumstances, and I hope that if you're reading this, you don't either. Naturally, I will never judge somebody solely on the basis that they use AI, because they may not be aware of the implications and trappings of it, but I can promise that I will never use it or anything generated by it knowingly.  </p>
