                      <p className="hero-description">
                        2024 was by far one of the craziest yet rewarding years
                        of my life. It was the culmination of at least two years
                        of turmoil and hard work, but in the end, it was worth
                        it.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        In comparison to the beginning of 2023 -- which saw me
                        losing my job and having to move back in with my parents
                        after nearly a decade of living on my own -- the
                        beginning of 2024 was a breeze. It was a bit chilly, but
                        I had a cozy job working as a barista at a local coffee
                        shop. The goal: to save enough money to leave my town
                        behind and finally take the leap into marriage. With my
                        then fiancée being Brazilian and US immigration being
                        both expensive and complicated for no good reason,
                        coupled with the US's disdain for the people of Latin
                        America, we decided that it would be best if I moved to
                        Brazil.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        By March, with everything I had saved the year prior, it
                        was time. The ticket had already been booked ahead of
                        time in an effort to make it cheaper and beat impending
                        visa requirements, so all that was left was to pack and
                        move. While I'm definitely the kind of person who would
                        move herself across the world to be with somebody, I'm
                        not foolish enough to go without having visited before.
                        I came to visit my wife for three months back in 2022,
                        back when she was still my girlfriend. Be that as it
                        may, that didn't stop everyone from asking if I knew
                        what I was getting myself into.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        And of course, while I couldn't be sure of all of the
                        cultural norms and quirks of Brazilian life, because
                        even Brazilians don't sometimes (the country is
                        massive), I had several years worth of lessons and
                        advice from my wife. Even still, that first trip was
                        like nothing I'd ever known -- and I loved every single
                        minute of it. Something about life in Brazil clicked
                        with me on a fundamental level, and even though I knew
                        it would be difficult to adjust, I knew I had to at
                        least go for it.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        So I did. I arrived in Brazil on the first of April,
                        2024, and my wife and I hit the ground running. We had
                        meticulously researched all the paperwork we needed both
                        for us to get married as well as for me to immigrate as
                        a legal permanent resident. That sprint soon ground to a
                        walk, because well... if you know anything about Brazil
                        outside of its beauty and the kindness of its people,
                        you would know that anything and everything is
                        bureaucratized. Dealing with it as a citizen is annoying
                        and painful at times, but navigating it as a gringa?
                        Excruciating.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        Still, we persisted despite the near-constant delays,
                        and we were able to get legally married. It took about a
                        month after that for us to get an appointment for my
                        residency interview, but I am happy to say that dealing
                        with the Polícia Federal was the most pleasant
                        government experience I've had to date. I was given
                        temporary card and told to wait three months for my
                        permanent one. And that, as they say, was that.
                      </p>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        By this point, it was nearly the holiday season, which
                        meant that for the first time since we'd started seeing
                        each other, my wife and I would get to spend my
                        birthday, Christmas, and New Years with each other. I
                        couldn't have been happier. With that, the year was
                        already over, and I was headed toward a brighter future.

                      <p className="hero-description">
                        Which brings us neatly to 2025.

                      <h3>2025 Goals</h3>
                      <p className="hero-description">
                        I want 2025 to be a year of productivity and prosperity.
                        I am aiming to work harder than ever to make that
                        happen, and for the first time in several years, I feel
                        the general malaise and brain fog disappearing as I make
                        a concerted effort to put the hours in each day.

                        <b>Coding:</b> This year I plan to take on more projects
                        than the last two years combined. I started off the year
                        strong with a commission for a portfolio website, but I
                        would like to increase my knowledge of React and sharpen
                        my existing skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to
                        become a well-rounded front-end web developer by year's
                        end. To start, I will complete Scrimba's free React
                        course, a course I bought on Udemy, and the Responsive
                        Web Design course on{" "}

                        . I expect that this alone will take over a hundred
                        hours, but alongside those courses I will also be
                        designing and coding websites for my portfolio. It goes
                        without saying, but polishing my website is at the top
                        of my priority list.

                        there before. I haven't cared for social media since
                        MySpace, and I never really felt a pressure to network
                        or connect. Now that I want to do web development full
                        time, I'm finding that connections are critical to
                        success. To that end, I recently made myself a{" "}

                        properly balancing the sedentary lifestyle that comes
                        with the job. Sitting in front of a computer all day and
                        plucking away at the keyboard, while my dream career,
                        leads to health complications if you're not careful. I
                        don't have any specific goals in mind, I just want to be
                        more active than I have been the past few months.

                        I can admit I was woefully unprepared as far as speaking
                        Portuguese goes. I can understand a lot of spoken
                        Portuguese and enough written Portuguese to be able to
                        read the news. Improving that will be my key to a happy
                        and successful life here.

                        <b>Gaming:</b> As an MMO lover, I've tried just about
                        every MMO out there, but I have to say, Final Fantasy XI
                        has a special place in my heart. It's an older, dated
                        game, sure, but the charm more than makes up for it. I
                        even got my wife into it at some point last year, but we
                        haven't really played it much since. I plan to rekindle
                        that spark and play a bunch of it this year. Guild Wars
                        2 is my current home MMO, and it's high time I got more
                        serious about actually playing it. I'd love to get full
                        map completion on at least one character, and ideally I
                        would like a set of Legendary armor.
